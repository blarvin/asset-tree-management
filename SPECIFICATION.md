This project is to prototype an asset tree management app. The goal of the app is to provide a hierarchical view of physical assets such as buildings, vehicles, or industrial systems. 

The overideing deisgn philosophy is a recursive tree structure, where nodes represent assets and their sub-assets. The nodes are identical at every level, and can have any number of nodes as children. This is similar to a file tree, except the containers (nodes) also have a data card showing any number of properties of the node itself at that point. This is all done with a single component, the Tree Node component. 

A second goal is "self-construction", which means the users of the app create and edit the assets and their structure themselves. 

A third goal is modeless or in-situ editing, which means the users can edit the assets, their structure, and all data card properties without having to leave the tree view.

```typescript
// TreeNode DB Schema
interface TreeNodeRecord {
  id: string;                    // Primary key (UUID), generated by client (metadata)
  nodeName: string;              // Name of the node, DISPLAYED in NodeTitle, user editable
  nodeSubtitle: string;          // Subtitle, DISPLAYED in NodeSubtitle, user editable
  parentId: string | null;       // Reference to parent ("ROOT" for top level node) (metadata)
  ancestorNamePath: string;      // Single string of all ancestor names, separated by "|" (metadata)
  virtualParents: string[];      // Virtual parent references. For the other end of a hose, wire, pipe, etc. Procedurally generated via UI. (metadata)
  createdBy: string;             // Creator ID, type: userID, generated by client (metadata)
  createdAt: EpochTimeStamp;     // Creation timestamp, generated by client (metadata)
  updatedBy: string;             // Last updater ID, type: userID, generated by client (metadata)
  updatedAt: EpochTimeStamp;     // Last update timestamp, generated by client (metadata)
  componentType: string;         // Component type, for special cases of a TreeNode such as isSettingsNode rather than a physical asset. (metadata)
  componentVersion: string;      // For feedback and debugging (metadata)
  customProperties: string[];	   // Such as API source, API key, etc. (metadata)
  nodeOrdering: number;          // Display order among siblings, probably won't be used for normal nodes, maybe for isSettingsNode. (metadata)
  dataFields: { [fieldId: string]: string }; // Store field IDs only, not the entire record (metadata)
  subAssets: { [nodeId: string]: boolean }; // Just references, not full objects (metadata)
}
```

```typescript
// DataField DB Schema
interface DataFieldRecord {
  id: string;                    // Primary key (UUID), generated by client (metadata)
  fieldName: string;             // Field name, usuallly DISPLAYED as label, user entered, user editable
  parentNodeId: string;          // Foreign key to TreeNode, (UUID), entered by client (metadata)
  dataValue: string;             // The actual value, user entered, user editable. May be of other types, but stored as string. DISPLAYED as DataValue.
  createdBy: string;             // Creator ID, type: userID, generated by client (metadata)
  createdAt: EpochTimeStamp;     // Creation timestamp, generated by client (metadata)
  updatedBy: string;             // Last updater ID, type: userID, generated by client (metadata)
  updatedAt: EpochTimeStamp;     // Last update timestamp, generated by client (metadata)
  cardOrdering: number;          // Position on DataCard, user editable via UI (metadata)
  componentType: string;         // Component type, user selected at creation e.g. "graphComponent", "imageCarouselComponent". (metadata)
  componentVersion: string;      // For feedback and debugging (metadata)
  customProperties: string[];	   // Such as API source, API key, etc. (metadata)
  isRequired: boolean;           // Whether the field is required (metadata)
  isLocked: boolean;             // Whether the field is locked, set by user (metadata)
  isEditable: boolean;           // Whether the field is editable (metadata)
}
```
